## _**About me**_

My name is Ekaterina Gorbacheva. I've started my professional career path in IT sphere in 2018. I had been working as a web designer (a freelancer) for 3 years and then I realised that a stage of developing of web sites is more interesting for me.

I'm a self-motivated, patient person. It helps me to succeed in the chosen profession. 
 
My strengths also include an open-mindedness, self-management and time management, teamwork, flexibility, listening skills.

## _**Code example**_
>_The Kata bellow is taken from a Codewars_

___Description:___

Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

>Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

___Requirements___:

* You can assume you will be given an integer input.

* You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well ( or 0 ).

* __NOTE on performance:__ There are no fancy optimizations required, but still the most trivial solutions might time out. Numbers go up to 2^31 ( or similar, depending on language ). Looping all the way up to n, or n/2, will be too slow.

```
function isPrime(num) {
  
  if ( num <= 1 ) return false;

  let n =  Math.sqrt(num);
  
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if ( num % i === 0) {
      return false; 
    } 
  }

  return true;
}
```
